<p>On August 28-29, Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge released critical updates
(versions 128.0.6613.114 and 128.0.2739.54 respectively)
which addressed security vulnerabilities. 
Unfortunately, we&#39;ve been receiving unusual bug reports since then.
<strong>While a patch is on the way, here’s how you can tackle the issue in the meantime</strong>.</p>

<p>Shortly after the problem arose, <strong>we started receiving numerous 1-star ratings</strong>.
Many people have happily used Dark Reader for years, yet this is how they respond.
Not only do <strong>99.9% of users ignore our calls for financial support</strong>.
But some even go further by ruining our rating and placement in the store.
Please remember that there are real people behind the app,
and <strong>such behavior from our users is deeply demotivating</strong>.</p>

<p>The best way to report an issue is by <strong>emailing us with screenshots and steps to reproduce the problem</strong>.
Tech-savvy users can also <strong>report issues on GitHub</strong>.
Thanks to the user who has recorded a video, so that we could finally see where to begin.</p>
<p>Some say that Dark Reader has become worse and slower, but the truth is quite the opposite.
Over the past year, <strong>we’ve implemented massive performance enhancements</strong> and <strong>significant memory optimizations</strong>.
Yet, the web itself is evolving rapidly—web applications are growing more complex,
standards and frameworks are constantly shifting, and <strong>websites are demanding more and more resources</strong>.</p>

</figure>

<p>We are relentlessly <strong>refining the app&#39;s engine</strong>, making it faster, more reliable, and ready to tackle new challenges.
Meanwhile, our efforts to <strong>enhance theme customization</strong> continue at full speed.
We deliver the best service possible within our budget and often go above and beyond—<strong>working tirelessly</strong>, even on holidays and weekends.</p>
<p>If you ask, <strong>&quot;How can I support such a great service?&quot;</strong> we have an answer. We’re now offering easy payment options: PayPal and Stripe (for card transactions). If you haven&#39;t supported us yet and have been using Dark Reader for a while,
<strong>now is the perfect time for a one-time payment</strong>.</p>

    <img src="/images/chromium-aw-snap.gif" alt="Demonstration of the Aw,Snap issue">
</figure>

<p>The problem occurs due to a <strong>scrollbar color change</strong> on the Google Search website and primarily <strong>affects Windows user</strong>.
If your browser <strong>window is small</strong>, you may encounter the &quot;Aw, Snap&quot; error when switching between the Google Search menus.
The Chromium bug has been reported and number <a href="https://issues.chromium.org/issues/363544341">363544341</a> was assigned.
You can <strong>star the issue to draw more attention from the Chromium developers</strong>.</p>
<p>We have already <strong>made a patch in version 4.9.90</strong> 🎉🎉🎉
and are currently awaiting manual review from the Google and Microsoft Store teams.</p>
